# dragon-donjon-ascii-viewer

A pretty viewer for XSM files generated by DRAGON/DONJON or APOLLO neutronic codes
What is it ?

As a DRAGON or DONJON user, you want to look inside a LCM object (LINKED_LIST, SEQ_ASCII or XSM_FILE). The simplest way to do this is to convert your object in XSM_FILE or SEQ_ASCII format :

XSM_FILE myXsmFile ; myXsmFile := myLCMObject ;

Open the resulting file with dragon-donjon-ascii-viewer and you'll be able to browse through it thanks to a treeview.
How to install
Check your configuration

ASCIIViewer requires Python and wxPython. On Unix system, open a terminal, type python and then import wx.

If you see : 

    $ python
    >>> import wx ImportError: No module named wx 

then wxPython is not installed. 
Don't worry ! It is possible to install it without administrator privileges. 
You should download this archive and run configure to know if you meet wxPython prerequisites. 
If you do, follow wxPython build instructions.
